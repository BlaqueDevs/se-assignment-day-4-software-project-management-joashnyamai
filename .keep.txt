|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**           | Iterative and incremental                                                | Linear and sequential                                             |
| **Flexibility**        | High; adapts to changes easily                                           | Low; changes are difficult to implement once the project starts   |
| **Customer Involvement**| Continuous feedback and collaboration                                    | Limited; feedback typically at the end                            |
| **Delivery**           | Frequent releases of small, functional increments                        | Single delivery at the end of the project                         |
| **Risk Management**    | Risks are identified and mitigated early                                 | Risks may only become apparent late in the project                |
| **Best For**           | Projects with evolving requirements or unclear scope                     | Projects with well-defined requirements and stable scope          |

**Advantages of Agile**:
- Faster delivery of functional components.
- Better adaptability to changing requirements.
- Improved team collaboration and morale.

**Disadvantages of Agile**:
- Requires active customer involvement.
- Can be challenging to manage in large teams or projects.

**Advantages of Waterfall**:
- Clear structure and documentation.
- Easy to manage for small, well-defined projects.
- Predictable timelines and budgets.

**Disadvantages of Waterfall**:
- Inflexible to changes.
- Late discovery of issues can be costly.

### In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

**Agile is more beneficial** for:
- **Dynamic Projects**: Where requirements are likely to change (e.g., mobile app development).
- **Innovative Projects**: Where the end goal is not fully defined (e.g., a startup building a new product).
- **Customer-Centric Projects**: Where continuous feedback is essential (e.g., e-commerce platforms).

**Example**: Developing a new social media app where user feedback shapes features.

**Waterfall is more beneficial** for:
- **Stable Projects**: Where requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change (e.g., regulatory compliance software).
- **Large-Scale Projects**: With fixed budgets and timelines (e.g., infrastructure upgrades).
- **Highly Regulated Industries**: Where documentation is critical (e.g., healthcare or aerospace).

**Example**: Building a payroll system for a company with fixed requirements.

### What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

**Methods for ensuring quality assurance**:
